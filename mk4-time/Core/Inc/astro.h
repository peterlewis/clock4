 * astro.h — minimal solar/lunar/grid astronomy for the Precision Clock Mk IV.
 *
 * Self-contained C99 + <math.h>; NO firmware dependencies, so it compiles and
 * unit-tests natively (see test_astro.c). All angles in degrees at the API
 * boundary; UTC instants are passed as a double of Unix seconds.
 *
 * Algorithms are low-precision (NOAA/Meeus-class) approximations — accurate to a
 * fraction of a degree / a minute or two, which is all a 7-segment readout shows,
 * and cheap enough to evaluate once per mode entry on the STM32's soft-double.
